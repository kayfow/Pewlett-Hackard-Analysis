# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
With any company that has been around for a long time, sometimes updates and upgades are needed, particularly to employee information and databases. Pewlett-Hackard (PH) is in the process of looking toward the future by identifying those looking into and plannning on retiring, providing retirement pacakges to those that the meet the criteria, as well as identifying roles that they will need to fill for those retiring. We've been tasked to help Bobby build am employee database with SQL, transitioning the company from traditionally using Excel and VBA.

### Results
* Overall, there was some redunancy in their data, of some employees that have taken on new systems, were input as new employees rather than having updated their employee file
* In addition to those that are retiring, currently, many departments have vacant posiitons of department managers, outside of those that will be retiring soon. 
* For mentorship, 1941 meet eligibility requirement to serve as mentors if they so choose.
* The retiring titles for PH range from senior to general staff positions, with senior engineers (44312) and senior staff (43797) having the highest. 

### Summary: 
* The number of roles that will need to filled to even out those that are retiring are 162,856.
* At the moment, by department, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees   to mentor those coming into PH (total: 36,619 by department; 1941 meet eligibility ); Additionally, if PH is looking to match mentors by the mentor's previous department to the current employees department, there may not be an even distribution. 
  * It would be helpful to include the following queries: 
   * Of the positions that are retiring, what departments do they fall into to look at mentorship, and to get a total number of mentors needed and to match mentors by department and potentially previous/incoming positions
   * creating an employee database that shows, if applicable, previous positions that employees have had so there is no redunancy in employees listed more than once if they've had a previous posiiton prior to their current one
